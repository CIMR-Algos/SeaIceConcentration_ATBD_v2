# Baseline Algorithm Definition for Sea Ice Concentration (SIC)

In the following sections, the Level-2 sea-ice concentration algorithm is further described. It consists in those steps:

The CIMR Level-2 {term}`SIC` algorithm has 3 main steps ({numref}`fig_sic_concept`):
1. L1B remapping
2. Computation of intermediate SICs
3. Pansharpening for Level-2 SICs.

Concept of the CIMR Level-2 {term}`SIC` processing moving from input L1B TB (left) to Level-2 SICs (right). Ellipses and colours represent
different microwave channels and their spatial resolution.
```

The first two steps above are applied three times, for three combinations of CIMR TB channels `CKA`, `KKA`, and `KA`. `CKA` and `KUKA` combinations
have both been tested in the EUMETSAT OSI SAF and ESA CCI Sea Ice projects {cite:p}`lavergne:2019:sicv2`. The `K` combination is the basis for the
'Polarization Mode' of the Bootstrap SIC algorithm {cite:p}`comiso:1986:sic,ivanova:2015:sicci1`.

{numref}`combis` introduces the three channel combinations used to prepare intermediate SICs in the Level-2 algorithm.
The channel combinations are applied at different spatial resolutions, dictated by the lowest frequency of the set. They result
in different accuracies (algorithms using C-band have better accuracy than those using only K and KA channels). Note that the '<= X km'
in column 'Resolution' corresponds to the spatial resolution after the L1B remapping step and is thus at least the native resolution of
the coarsest channel, but can also be better in case Backus-Gilbert techniques are implemented to take advantage of the overlap of FoVs
(most relevant at C-band and away from the swath center at K-band).

```{table} The three combinations of microwave channels used for the intermediate SICs.
:name: combis
| Id          | Channels  |  Resolution |  Accuracy |
| ----------- | --------  | ------ | ------ |
| `CKA`       | $\vec{T}=(\textrm{C-Vpol, KA-Vpol, KA-Hpol})$ |  C (<= 15 km)  |  Excellent |
| `KKA`      | $\vec{T}=(\textrm{K-Vpol, KA-Vpol, KA-Hpol})$ |  K (<= 5 km)  |  Good |
| `KA`        | $\vec{T}=(\textrm{KA-Vpol, KA-Hpol})$ |  KA (4-5 km)  |  Poor |
```

In {numref}`combis`, $\vec{T}$ is the vector of brightness temperature input to the SIC algorithm. As described later, the definition of the SIC algorithms
is slightly different for 2-dimensional algorithms (like `KA`: 2 imagery channels in $\vec{T}$) than for 3-dimensional algorithms (like `CKA` and `KKA`: 3
imagery channels in $\vec{T}$).

The third step deploys a pan-sharpening methodology to combine pairs of intermediate SICs into the final Level-2 SICs. Pan-sharpening (aka image fusion, resolution enhancement, etc...) is
a robust and straightforward method to improve the spatial resolution of a 'base' image by means of a 'sharpener' image. Pan-sharpening has been used
in many fields of Earth Observation, mostly with higher-resolution optical imagery {cite:p}`meng:2019:pansharpen,dadrasjavan:2021:pansharpen`. In the context of passive microwave SIC it has
been used in the NORSEX algorithm {cite:p}`kloster:1996:eocompendium` and more recently by {cite:t}`kilic:2020:sic` and in the context of the
ESA CCI+ Sea Ice project.

In our case, the 'base' image can be the high-accuracy / coarse-resolution intermediate SIC from `CKA` and the 'sharpener' image can be the
low-accuracy / fine-resolution intermediate SIC from `KA`. But other pan-sharpening combinations are possible. All pan-sharpened SICs
should be made available in the Level-2 product (with one of them given prominent visibility as an entry point).

```{table} Level-2 SICs, most of them obtained from pan-sharpening of intermediate SICs.
:name: pansharp
| Id          | Base image $C_{LR}$ |  Sharpener $C_{HR}$ | Target Resolution | Target Accuracy |
| ----------- | --------    | ------     | ------ | --- |
| `CKA`       | SIC from `CKA` | n/a | C (<= 15 km)  |  Excellent |
| `CKA@K`    | SIC from `CKA` | SIC from `KUKA` | K (<= 5 km)  |  Excellent |
| `CKA@KA`    | SIC from `CKA` | SIC from `KA` | KA (4-5 km)  |  Excellent |
| `KKA@KA`   | SIC from `KUKA` | SIC from `KA` | KA (4-5 km)  |  Good |
```

{numref}`pansharp` lists candidate Level-2 SICs from CIMR, most of them obtained from pan-sharpening of intermediate SICs (`CKA` is directly
from the intermediate SICs, without pan-sharpening). It is expected that one of these candidate Level-2 SICs will emerge as the best for most
users and be flagged as the main L2 SIC product (e.g. `CKA@KA`).

### Retrieval Method

As introduced above, the CIMR Level-2 SIC processing implements a series of steps that are run on three different combinations of microwave channels. Here
we present the steps on a generic channel combination. We refer to this generic description later in the chapter when describing the actual implementation.

#### A generic formulation for a SIC algorithm and its uncertainties

At any microwave channel $i$, and neglecting the contribution of the atmosphere to the signal, the TB recorded by CIMR over polar ocean areas is a linear combination of the
typical signature of open water $<T_{i}^{W}>$ (the open water tie-point), and of the typical signature of consolidated ice (100\% SIC) $<T_{i}^{I}>$ (the sea ice tie-point).
The weighting between the two signatures is the {term}`SIC` (noted $C$). Considering $n$ microwave channels leads to:

$$
\left \{
\begin{array}{c}
T_{1} = (1 - C) \times <T_{1}^{W}> + C \times <T_{1}^{I}> \\
... \\
T_{n} = (1 - C) \times <T_{n}^{W}> + C \times <T_{n}^{I}>
\end{array}
\right.
$$ (eq_mixTb)

where $<T>$ stands for the average $T$.

By re-arranging the terms in Eq. {eq}`eq_mixTb`, and taking the dot product of both sides of the equations by a unit vector \vec{v}, we obtain:

$$
C(\vec{T}) = \frac{\vec{v} \cdot (\vec{T} - <\vec{T}^W>)}{\vec{v} \cdot (<\vec{T}^I> - <\vec{T}^W>)}
$$ (eq_mixC2)

where $\vec{T}=(T_1,...,T_i,...,T_n)$ the vector of $T_B$ measured in $n$ channels, and $\vec{v}=(v_1,...,v_i,...,v_n)$ a unit vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$ ($\|\vec{v}\|=1$). In general, $\vec{T}$ can include all
microwave channels of a microwave imager ($n=10$ for CIMR counting only the V- and H-pol channels). For this Level-2 SIC algorithm however, we consider $n=2$ (`KA` configuration) and $n=3$ (`CKA` and `KKA` configurations).

Eq. {eq}`eq_mixC2` defines a general form for our SIC algorithms. The SIC is the ratio of the distance from the measured TB to the water tie-point, to the distance between the ice and the water tie-points, both distances being measured along an $n$-dimensional direction $\vec{v}$. By construction, these algorithms all achieve zero bias on average at the water and consolidated sea-ice cases, since $C(<\vec{T}^W>)=0$ and $C(<\vec{T}^I>)=1$.

Vector $\vec{v}$ holds the coefficients of the algorithm, that give relative weights to the $n$ channels. Once the tie-point are known, the crux of designing algorithms is thus to find $\vec{v}$ that yields the best SIC accuracy.

Uncertainty propagation can be applied to express the uncertainty in $C(\vec{T})$ as a function of the uncertainties in the free parameters in equation {eq}`eq_mixC2`: 

$$
\Sigma_C = \frac{1}{(\vec{v} \cdot (<\vec{T}^I>-<\vec{T}^W>))^2} [ \vec{v}\Sigma_T\vec{v}^T + (1-C)^{2}\times \vec{v}\Sigma_W\vec{v}^T + C^{2}\times \vec{v}\Sigma_I\vec{v}^T ]
$$ (eq_varFull)

The three terms in Eq. {eq}`eq_varFull` correspond respectively to the uncertainty contribution due to the radiometer instrument noise (the Ne$\Delta$T), the geo-physical
uncertainty of the Water emissivities (including surface effects from wind roughening, temperature, etc...) and those of the Ice emissivities (including a number of contributions
such as ice type, snow depth, layering, etc...)

Eq. {eq}`eq_varFull` expresses the total uncertainty (variance) of SIC as a combination of the uncertainty (variance) contributions from the Water and Ice signatures (\emph{aka} tie-points uncertainty)
and the instrument noise, normalized by the dynamic range between Ice and Water mean signatures, measured along the direction of $\vec{v}$. If the dynamic range (in the denominator) is small with
respect to the uncertainties (in the numerator), then the total uncertainty will be large. This is the main reason why algorithm using C-band (large dynamic range between water and ice) have lower
retrieval uncertainty than those only using K- or KA-band (smaller dynamic range).

An alternative expression for eq. {eq}`eq_varFull` is given in eq. {eq}`eq_varSimp`:

$$
\Sigma_C = \Sigma_{Ne \Delta T} + (1-C)^{2} \times \Sigma_{CW} + C^{2} \times \Sigma_{CI}
$$ (eq_varSimp)

with

$$
\Sigma_{Ne \Delta T} = \frac{\vec{v}\Sigma_T\vec{v}^T}{(\vec{v} \cdot (<\vec{T}^I>-<\vec{T}^W>))^2}
$$ (eq:varT)

$$
\Sigma_{CW} = \frac{\vec{v}\Sigma_W\vec{v}^T}{(\vec{v} \cdot (<\vec{T}^I>-<\vec{T}^W>))^2}
$$ (eq:varW)

$$
\Sigma_{CI} = \frac{\vec{v}\Sigma_I\vec{v}^T}{(\vec{v} \cdot (<\vec{T}^I>-<\vec{T}^W>))^2}
$$ (eq:varI)

Scalars $\Sigma_{CW}$ and $\Sigma_{CI}$ are the uncertainty (variance) achieved at the low-end (open water) and high-end (consolidated ice) of the sea-ice concentration range.
They are the two scalars we want to minimize when tuning our SIC algorithms. Given the variance-covariance matrices of the radiometric-induced noise, and those induced by the water
and the consolidated ice signatures, the algorithm coefficients embedded in $\vec{v}$ control if the algorithm is more or less accurate at either end of the SIC range. 

(dynamic_tuning)=
#### Dynamic tuning of the generic SIC algorithm

The algorithm coefficients embedded in $\vec{v}$ control the retrieval accuracy (eq. {eq}`eq_varSimp`) of the generic SIC algorithm (eq. {eq}`eq_mixC2`). An important step
for defining a SIC algorithm is thus to tune $\vec{v}$ to achieve best accuracy. Consider a set of TB samples extracted over known 0% SIC conditions, and another set extracted
over known 100% SIC conditions. We describe below the procedure to tune a generic SIC algorithm against these two TB samples. The strategies to select these TB samples will be
presented at a later stage.

##### Computation of the tie-points and tie-points variability

From the set of TBs for known 0% SIC conditions, we compute the mean TB signature $<\vec{T}^W>$ (the water tie-point) and the variance-covariance matrix of the variability around the tie-point: $\Sigma_W$. 

From the set of TBs for known 100% SIC conditions, we compute the mean TB signature $<\vec{T}^I>$ (the ice tie-point) and the variance-covariance matrix of the variability around the tie-point: $\Sigma_I$. 

__A 1-dimensional algorithm__ ($n=1$) is fully defined once the tie-points $<\vec{T}^W>$ and $<\vec{T}^I>$ are specified (see eq. {eq}`eq_mixC2` with $\vec{v}=1$, a scalar). Except possible at L-band, such
1-dimensional algorithms are however not accurate enough, because the TB variability around the two tiepoints translates into higher retrieval uncertainties (see {eq}`eq_varFull` with $\vec{v}=1$, a scalar).
To exploit better spatial resolution and thus using the higher frequency channels, SIC investigators had to adopt multi-dimensional SIC algorithms. In higher dimensions, SIC algorithms are not fully defined
by the two tiepoints, and the definition and tuning of $\vec{v}$ becomes critical to the accuracy.

##### Defining $\vec{u}$ as the vector sustaining the ice line

We compute the unit vector $\vec{u}$ that sustains the direction of largest variance in $\vec{v}\Sigma_I$. $\vec{u}$ is obtained by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the set of TBs for
known 100% SIC conditions. $\vec{u}$ defines the "consolidated ice line", a concept used in many heritage SIC algorithms including the Bootstrap algorithms {cite:p}`comiso:1986:sic` and
the Bristol algorithm {cite:p}`smith:1996:bristol`. The ice line extends from Multiyear ice ({term}`MYI`) to First-Year ice ({term}`FYI`). Because KA-band offers the best dynamic range across the different
ice types, it is used in all three channel configurations (`CKA`, `KKA` and `KA`). The main purpose of including KA-band is to anchor $\vec{u}$ along the ice-line.

Once $\vec{u}$ is known a scalar quantity $d$ can be computed for each vector $\vec{T}$. We call $d$ the “Distance Along the Line” ({term}`DAL`):

$$
d = \vec{T} \cdot \vec{u}
$$ (eq_dal)

##### Optimizing $\vec{v}$ perpendicularly to the ice line

As in the Bootstrap and Bristol algorithms, we impose that vector $\vec{v}$ is orthogonal to vector $\vec{u}$.

$$
\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} = 0
$$ (eq_vdotu)

This ensures that eq. {eq}`eq_mixC2` return a SIC of 100% for all TB points exactly on the ice line. By construction, eq. {eq}`eq_mixC2` returns the same SIC value for all TBs along a line parallel to the ice-line.

__For a 2-dimensional algorithm__ ($n=2$ as for the `KA` configuration), the constraint in eq. {eq}`eq_vdotu` results in a
unique vector $\vec{v}$. Indeed, let $\vec{u}=(u_1,u_2)$ then $\vec{v}=(-u2,u1)$. A 2-dimensional algorithm like `KA` is
fully defined from the two sets of TBs over known ocean and ice conditions, since those sets define the tie-points
$<\vec{T}^W>$ and $<\vec{T}^I>$, as well as $\vec{u}$ and automatically $\vec{v}$.

__For a 3-dimensional algorithm__ ($n=3$ as for the `CKA` and the `KKA` configurations), the constraint in eq. {eq}`eq_vdotu`
does not define a unique vector $\vec{v}$. One degree of freedom is left for defining $\vec{v}$: the rotation angle $\theta_v$ around
the ice-line defined by $\vec{u}$. An infinity of $\vec{v}$ - and thus an infinity of SIC algorithms as defined by eq. {eq}`eq_mixC2` - 
pass the constraint in eq. {eq}`eq_vdotu`. To fully define a 3-dimensional algorithm, we find the rotation angle $\theta_v$ that
minimizes the retrieval uncertainty of the algorithm for either the set of known 0% SIC conditions, or the set of known 100% SIC
conditions. In general, the $\theta_v$ that minimizes the retrieval uncertainty over open water conditions does not minimize the
retrieval uncertainty over consolidated ice conditions (and vice-versa). We thus define two $\theta_v$ values, corresponding to
two $\vec{v}$ vectors and thus two SIC algorithms. The concept of a 3-dimensional algorithm and the optimization of the rotation
angle $\theta_v$ are illustrated on {numref}`fig_3d_rotation` (reproduced from {cite:t}`lavergne:2019:sicv2` adapted from {cite:t}`smith:1996:bristol`). The two SIC algorithms, called "BestIce" and "BestOW", will be combined
into a hybrid SIC algorithm as described in {ref}`sec_hybrid_sics`.

```{figure} ./static_imgs/SIC_3d_and_rotation.png

The direction U (violet, sustained by unit vector $\vec{u}$) is shown, and vectors $\vec{v}_{Bristol}$ (blue), $\vec{v}_{BestIce}$ (red), and $\vec{v}_{BestOW}$ (green) are added, as well as an illustration of the optimization of the direction

```

The optimization of $\theta_v$ values uses a Quaternion rotation notation in 3 dimensions. A brute-force approach is chosen where
all $\theta_v$ values in the range $[-90^{\circ};+90^{\circ}]$ are tested with a step of $1^{\circ}$.

__In higher dimensions__ ($n>3$), the contraint in eq. {eq}`eq_vdotu` leaves ($n-2 >= 2$) degrees of freedom, which requires other optimization approaches than the
brute-force strategy we adopt in 3 dimensions. Such higher dimensions SIC algorithms are not envisaged for the CIMR Level-2 SIC product.


(sec_hybrid_sics)=
#### An hybrid SIC algorithms

As introduced above, a 2-dimensional algorithm (like in the `KA` configuration) can only be tuned in terms of tie-points $<\vec{T}^W>$ and $<\vec{T}^I>$ and $\vec{u}$ (that itself imposes $\vec{v}$).
Eq. {eq}`eq_mixC2` is used directly to compute SIC from $\vec{T}$.


For 3-dimensional algorithms like `CKA` and the `KKA`, however, we can tune an algorithm that performs best over the low SIC range (noted $C_{BestOW}$ or $C_{OW}$) and another algorithm that performs best
over the high SIC range (noted noted $C_{BestIce}$ or $C_{CI}$). In order to compute a single SIC value for a given $\vec{T}$, we design an hybrid SIC algorithm that combines $C_{OW}$ and $C_{CI}$
linearly:

$$
C(\vec{T}) = w_{OW} \times C_{OW}(\vec{T}) + (1 - w_{OW}) \times C_{CI}(\vec{T}) \\
$$ (eq_hybridC)

with

$$
w_{OW} = \left \{\begin{array}{c}
1 \textrm{ for } C_{OW}(\vec{T}) < 0.7 \\
0 \textrm{ for } C_{OW}(\vec{T}) > 0.9 \\
\frac{C_{OW}(\vec{T}) - 0.7}{0.2} \textrm{ for } C_{OW}(\vec{T}) \in [0.7;0.9] \\
\end{array}
\right.
$$ (eq_hybridC_w)

Eq. {eq}`eq_hybridC` and {eq}`eq_hybridC_w` are used to compute a single SIC value from an input $\vec{T}$. This involves eq. {eq}`eq_mixC2` twice (once for $C_{OW}(\vec{T})$ and once for $C_{CI}(\vec{T})$).
The same weighting equation in eq. {eq}`eq_hybridC` is used to combine the uncertainty estimates (variances) $\Sigma_C$ of $C_{OW}$ and $C_{CI}$ (computed using eq. {eq}`eq_varSimp`).

To summarize, SICs in the `CKA` and `KKA` channels combinations are computed using eq. {eq}`eq_hybridC` while
SICs in the `KA` channel combination are computed using eq. {eq}`eq_mixC2` directly.

#### Open Water Filter (OWF), thresholding, and climatology masking of SIC

The SIC algorithms described above will return non-zero (positive and negative) SIC values over over open water (0% SIC), even far away from the ice edge. This is because
the algorithms are mostly linear-combinations of the brightness temperatures, and the variability of TB around the open water tie-point. In the high SICs range, the algorithms
above will sometimes return SIC values above 100% SIC for the same reason.

Historically, these noisy, non-physical SIC values have been removed from the SIC products accessed by the users. Two common filtering techniques have been applied:
1. Open Water Filtering ({term}`OWF`) (aka Weather Filtering);
2. Thresholding at 100% and 0% SIC;
3. Climatology masking.

(sec_owf)=
##### Open Water Filter
The {term}`OWF` is a filter that detects where the ocean is most probably free for ice, and sets the SIC value to 0% SIC in the final product. This filter is needed to get
exactly 0% SIC over large ocean areas away from the ice cover. Historically, OWFs have been based on the K- and KA-band channels, sometimes also 22.2 GHz. It generally involved so-called 'Gradient Ratio'
{term}`GR` values.

In the CIMR Level-2 SIC algorithm, we follow recent developments at the EUMETSAT OSI SAF and rather use a normalized version of the {term}`DAL` metric (eq. {eq}`eq_dal`) as the basis for
the {term}`OWF`. The normalization of DAL involves SIC, a tie-point for First-Year Ice {term}`FYI` and a “low-weather” (LW) tie-point:

$$
d_{OWF}=d−((1−SIC) \times \vec{u} \cdot <\vec{T}^{LW}> + SIC \times \vec{u} \cdot <\vec{T}^{FYI}>)
$$ (eq_dal_owf)

```{figure} ./static_imgs/owf_diagram.png
--- 
name: fig_owf

Example use of $d$ and $d_{OWF}$ for Open Water Filtering with the SSMIS mission. Top row for the Arctic, bottom row for the Southern Ocean.
Panels from left to right show the Tb samples (small dots) of 0% SIC (blue) and 100% SIC (orange) in a (x:37v,y:19v) space (left panel),
(x:$d$, y:SIC) space (middle panel), and (x:$d_{OWF}$,y:SIC) space (right panel). Tie-points (triangles) for Open Water (yellow), Low Weather (red),
High Weather (green), and First-Year Ice (black) are also reported, as well as the domain detected as Open Water by the Open Water Filter
(red area in right panel).
```

{numref}`fig_owf` illustrates how the clusters of 0% and 100% SIC conditions are distributed in
three 2D domain relevant for the Open Water Filter. The left-most panels are in the
(x:37v, y:19v) Tb space that sustains the traditional Weather Filter through the use of a Gradient Ratio test.
The middle panels show the same data in the (x:$d$, y:SIC) space,
to illustrate the intermediate step in the coordinate transform from the left-most to
the right-most panels and locate the LW nad FYI tie-points. In the right-most panels, data points are plotted in the
(x:$d_{OWF}$,y:SIC) space that sustains the OWF in the CIMR Level-2 SIC ATBD. The (x:$d_{OWF}$,y:SIC)
space is built so that the intermediate SIC conditions will mostly fall onto and to the
left of the (LW, FYI) line (vertical at x=0 in this 2D space).

In this space, the OWF is implemented with two binary tests (see red area in the right-most panels of {numref}`fig_owf`):

$$
\left \{\begin{array}{c}
 SIC \le 0.1  \\
 SIC \le 0.1 + (0.5 – 0.1) \times \frac{d_{OWF}}{d_{HW}} \\
 \end{array}
 \right.
 $$ (eq_owf_test)

In eq. {eq}`eq_owf_test`, $d_{HW}$ is a point in the ($d_{OWF}$, SIC) space corresponding to “heavy weather contamination point” at the 95% percentile of the $d_{OWF}$ values.
Eq. {eq}`eq_owf_test` detect as water all TA samples that fall below the line going through points (x:0,y=0.1) and (x:$d_{HW}$,y:0.5) (the latter marked with a red star on {numref}`fig_owf`).

TB observations that fulfill any of the two conditions in eq. {eq}`eq_owf_test` (Test1 OR Test2) are flagged (OWF=True) as “probably open water”, and their SIC is set to 0% in
the final Level-2 product file. This filtering is recorded in the status flags, and the "raw" (un-filtered) SICs are also kept in a dedicated variable of the Level-2 product file
for expert users (e.g. Data Assimilation).

##### Thresholding at 100% and 0% SIC

The {term}`OWF` described in {ref}`sec_owf` will generally detect all open water areas in the polar regions, and set their SIC to exactly 0%. By construction, the OWF does not modify the SIC over
ice-infested regions. As a results, the SIC field after OWF still has some non-physical values larger than 100%. These values are thresholded to exactly 100%, and the original "raw" values
are kept in  a dedicated variable of the Level-2 product file.

Although all of them should have been removed by the OWF, potential remaining negative SICs are also thresholded to exactly 0% SIC, and the original "raw" values are kept in a
dedicated variable of the Level-2 product file.

##### Climatology masking

High water vapour content in the tropics can fool the SIC algorithms in returning high SIC values. A monthly varying maximum sea-ice climatology mask is applied to the L1B swath to only compute the Level-2 SICs
in the polar regions. Field-of-views outside the maximum climatology mask are either removed from the Level-2 product file, or set to 0% SIC.

(sec_pansharpen)=
#### Enhanced-resolution SICs using pan-sharpening

The sections above described generically how intermediate SIC fields can be prepared from different channel combinations of CIMR's imagery (`CKA`, `KKA`, `KA`). As a result of the input channels, these intermediate SIC fields will have different
spatial resolution, and different expected accuracy (see {numref}`combis`). The next step in the processing of CIMR Level-2 SIC product is to combine these intermediate SIC fields using a pan-sharpening approach, to obtain final SIC fields
that have both high resolution and high accuracy (see {numref}`pansharp` and {numref}`fig_sic_concept`).

Pan-sharpening techniques were introduced for improving the spatial resolution of high-resolution optical imagery missions - such as SPOT - in the 1980s. This type of mission typically
offered a pan-chromatic imagery band with high spatial resolution (but covering a broad range of wavelengths) and multi-spectral imagery (narrower bandwidth but lower spatial resolution because less photons are recorded). Pan-sharpening techniques
emerged for combining the fine details of the pan-chromatic imagery with the information content of the multi-spectral imagery to provide high-resolution multi-spectral imagery. Nowadays many pan-sharpening techniques exist for many missions
(see e.g. a review in {cite:t}`meng:2019:pansharpen`} or {cite:t}`dadrasjavan:2021:pansharpen`).

In the field of sea-ice concentration monitoring from passive microwave radiometer data, pan-sharpening has been used recently (e.g. in {cite:t}`ludwig:2019:sic` and {cite:t}`kilic:2020:sic`), noting the early work of {cite:t}`kloster:1996:eocompendium`
with the NORSEX algorithm of {cite:t}`svendsen:1987:norsex`. A pan-sharpening was also selected in the ESA CCI Sea Ice to produce a 30-years Climate Data Record of SIC.

We select a robust and simple pan-sharpening formulation for the CIMR Level-2 SIC product:

$$
\begin{array}{lcc}
C_{ER} &=& \textrm{Remap}_{HR}(C_{LR}) +  \Delta_{edges} \\
       &=& \textrm{Remap}_{HR}(C_{LR}) + ( C_{HR} - C_{HR, blurred} ) \\
\end{array}
$$ (eq_pansharpen)

In Eq. {eq}`eq_pansharpen`, suffix "ER" refers to enhanced resolution (the final SIC), "LR" to "low resolution" (the SIC to be pan-sharpened),
and "HR" to "high resolution" (the SIC used as sharpener). Eq. {eq}`eq_pansharpen` also involves $C_{HR, blurred}$ which is C_{HR} blurred to
the spatial resolution of $C_{LR}$. The quantity $( C_{HR} - C_{HR, blurred})$ is sometimes referred to as a $\Delta_{edges}$ as it takes
small values everywhere but in the regions where $C_{HR}$ exhibits sharp gradients (e.g. in the {term}`MIZ`). The $\textrm{Remap}_{HR}$ operator
remaps the location (only the location, not the resolution) of $C_{LR}$ to those of $C_{HR}$ to enable adding the two fields together.
The resulting SIC field, $C_{ER}$ is
thus at the locations of $C_{HR}$, with the spatial resolution of $C_{HR}$ and the accuracy of $C_{LR}$ (if the pan-sharpening works perfectly).

To the best of our knowledge, the CIMR Level-2 SIC product is the first time the pan-sharpening technique will be used in swath projection for passive microwave
SIC retrieval (previous investigations have been deploying the technique on Earth gridded fields).

{numref}`fig_pansharpen_ex` gives an illustration of the resolution enhancement capability of the pan-sharpening technique with the {term}`SSM/I` mission. In that case,
the "LR" SIC was from a `KKA` configuration, and the "HR" SIC from using W-band (85.5 GHz) imagery. Transposed to CIMR, a candidate "LR" would be from `CKA` and "HR" from `KA`.

At this stage, we cannot foresee what is the combination of intermediate SICs that will achieve best results (in terms of resolution and accuracy) for the CIMR Level-2 SIC product.
We thus write this ATBD considering several options for SIC fields in the final Level-2 product file ({numref}`fig_sic_concept`). These candidate combinations are listed in {numref}`pansharp`.

### CIMR Level-1b re-sampling approach

The CIMR Level-2 SIC algorithm involves re-sampling and re-mapping at two stages. The Level-1b brightness
temperature samples must be remapped on common location and resolution before applying the `CKA`, `KKA`,
and `KA` algorithms ({numref}`fig_sic_concept`). At a later stage, the intermediate SICs $C_{CKA}$, $C_{KKA}$, and $C_{KA}$ must be re-sampled
and re-mapped as part of the pan-sharpening step ({ref}`sec_pansharpen`).

At the time of writing, the exact method for re-sampling and re-mapping is not defined. The method
might depend on which algorithm is to be applied. For example, the `CKA` algorithm might benefit
from a Backus-Gilbert approach that takes advantage of the overlap of C-band FoVs. On the other hand,
`KKA` and `KA` do not involve much overlap between neighbouring FoVs and can thus probably be
handled with simpler methods.

Illustration of the scanning pattern of CIMR, with a focus on the C/X and K/KA feeds. This shows a portion of a scanline for the C/X feed system (4 feeds),
and for the K/KA feed system (8 feeds). The L-band scanline is not shown (as it has only 1 feed, and is not used in the SIC/SIED algorithm). Colors are for OZAs. 
```

Another aspect to consider is that the different feeds of the CIMR mission do not have the same
OZA (Observation Zenith Angle), which can create stripes in the TB imagery ({numref}`fig_cimr_scan`). Adjusting for the OZA
dependency of TBs must be catered for before the L1B resampling, in a pre-processing step before
calling the L2 SIC and SIED algorithms.

In the current implementation, three types of L1B resampling are used, depending on the SIC algorithm:
* `KA` : This algorithm uses only TBs from a single frequency (two polarization): there is no need for resampling before applying the SIC algorithm.
* `KKA` : This algorithm uses TBs from two frequencies (K and KA) that are from dual-frequency feeds. The selected resampling approach is an along-arc
         resampling that does not mix between feeds, and thus does not mix between different OZAs.
* `CKA` : This algorithm uses TBs from two frequencies (C and KA) that are from different feeds. This require a *classic* resampling (e.g. Backus Gilbert)
         to resample the position and resolution of the KA TBs to those of the C-band TBs.

### Algorithm Assumptions and Simplifications

There are several assumptions and simplifications embedded in the selected algorithm. We describe the
main ones below.

#### Linear scaling of TB with SIC
The basis for most SIC algorithms (including the one selected here) is that an increase in 
SIC will result in an increase in observed TB. This assumes that the atmosphere is transparent
which is mostly the case at polar latitudes for the CIMR frequencies. If the atmosphere is
not transparent enough, corrections based on {term}`RTM` can be used to return to a state
where the basis linearity hypothesis is valid.

#### Large-scale validity of the tie-points
Tie-points are TB values that are characteristics of pure surface (e.g. {term}`OW`, {term}`FYI`, etc...)
These are typically defined once for all, but can also be adapted on a daily basis as is done in the
OSI SAF processing chains. Irrespective of their update frequency, the tie-points are then used for
all TB observations in a specific hemisphere, irrespective of the sub-region observed. The tie-points
are considered to capture the average sea ice conditions, but regional variability in emissivity
exist, and can lead to regional over/under-estimation of the SIC. Region-specific tie-points might
be required for monitoring ice on fresh or brackwish waters.

#### Under-estimation of thin sea ice

Due to many factors (including smooth surface, absence of snow, brine content) concentration of thin sea-ice
(<30 cm) is underestimated by most of the PMW SIC algorithms {cite:p}`cavalieri:1994:nasaT`. A complete, 100 % cover
of thin sea ice will be retrieved with a lower concentration, depending on the thickness and the
microwave frequencies used in the algorithm {cite:p}`ivanova:2015:sicci1`. This underestimation is
largest for lower frequencies such as L- or C-band.

#### Land spill-over

The radiometric signature of land is similar to that of sea ice at the wavelengths used for estimating the SIC.
Because of the large footprints and the relatively high brightness temperatures of land and ice compared to
water, the land signature “spills” into the coastal zone open water and it will falsely appear as
intermediate concentration ice.

This land-spillover effect can be partly corrected by estimating the fractional contribution of land surface
to each Level-1B sample or FoV. However, coastal correction procedures are not perfect, and some false
sea ice might remain along some coastlines and in fjords.

### Derivation of total standard uncertainty

The total uncertainty of L2 SIC (and its components) can be derived through uncertainty propagation analysis
from Eq. {eq}`eq_hybridC`. In most cases, the main uncertainty source for the computation of SIC is not the
total uncertainty of the L1B input (uncertainty *propagation* to L2) but rather the uncertainty of the
algorithm tie-points (uncertainty *injection* at L2).

Work initiated in the CIMR MACRAD study confirmed the results of {cite}`ivanova:2015:sicci1` that the
uncertainties propagated from L1B TBs are typically of an order of magnitude smaller than those injected
at L2 by the tie-point uncertainties, even for relatively 'noisy' channels as CIMR KA-band. In general,
a good estimate of the L2 SIC uncertainties thus requires a good estimate of the tie-point uncertainties,
not of the L1B uncertainty.

This general picture must however be nuanced in two cases:
1. The systematic (i.e. calibration) uncertainties in the CIMR L1B TOA TBs can have a direct impact on the
systematic uncertainaties (i.e. bias). This is the reason why we suggest to implement
{ref}`dynamic tuning of algorithm tie-points <dynamic_tuning>` for the CIMR L2 SIC algorithm
{cite}`tonboe:2016:sicv1,ivanova:2015:sicci1,lavergne:2019:sicv2`.
2. In coastal regions, the uncertainty of the Land-corrected L1B TBs will increase sharply due to the
smaller contribution of water target to the TOA signal, the uncertainty of the fraction of land $\alpha$,
and the uncertainty in the local Land emissivity. Coastal SICs
might thus see a larger contribution to their uncertainty from the TBs than from the tie-points.

{numref}`fig_uncTree` presents an early version of the SIC uncertainty tree diagram, loosely using the format
adopted in the EU FIDUCEO and QA4EO initiatives {cite}`mittaz:2019:uncert`. The SIC measurement function
is at the center, and branches of the tree describe the uncertainty contribution from each term,
including an indication (text) of the correlation structure of the uncertainties. These correlation
structure would typically be expressed in Effect Tables.

Uncertainty tree diagram for the SIC measurement function. The measurement equation of SIC is at the center of the diagram,
and each branch of the tree describes the uncertainty propagation from a specific element in the SIC
equation. The $+0$  term is a notation for the unknown systematic uncertainties.
```

A detailed description of the terms in {numref}`fig_uncTree` is not give here, but the reader is
invited to note the different blocks of uncertainties:
* $u(T^{1B}_{B})$ for uncertainty propagation from L1B
* $u(T^{I}_{B})$ and $u(T^{W}_{B})$ for the Water and Ice tie-point uncertainty
* $u(T^{\epsilon}_B)$ for uncertainty propagation through the RGB remapper
* the $+0$ term to capture the unknown systematic uncertainties and limitations of such SIC algorithm (e.g. those covered in {ref}`sec_assumptions`)

In addition, note the dashed curve that runs between the three $u()$ terms. It represents the fact that the
Water and Ice tie-points are dynamically tuned from subsets of L1B TBs, and that they thus all
share the systematic (i.e. calibration) uncertainties, thus ensuring that the L2 SIC algorithm
is and remains un-biased at the large (hemispheric) scales.

The methodology to compute SIC uncertainties during the processing is not decided at this stage.
We can either run own software implementing uncertainty propagation formulas, or rely on the
(python) software in the [CoMeT toolkit](https://www.comet-toolkit.org/tools/)
(and in particular the PunPy tool). The use of PunPy is under investigation in the on-going
CIMR MACRAD study.

contribution to the total L2 SIC uncertainty. Note how the simulations agree giving confidence that we could
operate the PunPy tool for such a SIC algorithm. Note also the overal amount of the SIC uncertainty which is of below 4\% RMSE
(while the CIMR MRD v5 requirement is <5\%).
