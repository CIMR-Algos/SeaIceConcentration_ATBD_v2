## Sea Ice Concentration (SIC3H)

The proposed algorithm for {term}`SIC3H` stems from the long history of developments
by the EUMETSAT {term}`OSI SAF` and the ESA {term}`CCI` Sea Ice teams.

Since the early 2000s, the OSI SAF have been developing state-of-the-art algorithms including swath-based
retrievals, dynamic generation of tie-points, atmospheric correction
of the brightness temperatures using {term}`RTM`s, and per-FoV uncertainties. Traditionally,
these algorithms have used the K and KA microwave bands from the {term}`SSMIS` and 
later the {term}`AMSR2` missions.

Since the mid 2010s, the CCI Sea Ice projects have contributed critical R&D input to the
original OSI SAF approach. Of particular relevance to the proposed CIMR Level-2 SIC algorithm are
the demonstration of the benefits of using C-band (in combination with KA-band) radiometry, and
the demonstration of using pan-sharpening techniques to take advantage of high(er) resolution microwave
imagery. {cite:t}`lavergne:2019:sicv2` gives an overview of the algorithm baseline including the
use of C-band radiometry, and {cite:t}`sicci+1:2021:sic_atbd` describes the use of pan-sharpening
(using near-90 GHz imagery).

The proposed CIMR Level-2 SIC algorithm take full advantage of these approaches by exploiting
the C-, K-, and KA-band imagery of CIMR with dynamic tuning of the tie-points, and pan-sharpening
techniques to obtain <5 km, <5% SICs meeting the CIMR mission requirements ([AD-1]).

Although many developments have been materialized through OSI SAF and CCI SIC R&D, the proposed
algorithm also relates to earlier and recent developments by other investigators, e.g. the 
Bootstrap and Bristol SIC algorithms {cite:p}`comiso:1986:sic,smith:1996:bristol` and the use of
pan-sharpening techniques {cite:p}`kloster:1996:eocompendium,kilic:2020:sic`.

## Sea Ice Concentration 1H (SIC1H)

The CIMR {term}`SIC1H` Level-2 product has two driving requirements: the {term}`Near Real Time 1H` latency, and
the <5 km resolution to support operational sea-ice services with safe navigation. Compared to the nominal 
{term}`SIC3H` Level-2 product, the requirement for accuracy of the {term}`SIC1H` Level-2 product is relaxed.

We propose to implement the CIMR {term}`SIC1H` Level-2 processing chain with building blocks from the {term}`SIC3H`
algorithm but removing some steps that require most computing time. For example, the {term}`SIC1H` product might
be built only on K and KA imagery, and do not use {term}`RTM` correction of the brightness temperature. Another
time-saving step can be to not estimate uncertainties, or at least with a simplified algorithm.

## Sea Ice Edge (SIED)

We derive {term}`Sea Ice Edge` from the SIC, by finding the FoVs whose SIC is higher than a threshold (TBC, but generally
15%). This allows a low-cost derivation of this Level-2 product, that ensures consistency with the SIC product.
