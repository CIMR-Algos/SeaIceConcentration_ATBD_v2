# CIMR L2 Sea Ice Concentration and Sea Ice Edge ATBD

This repository holds the ATBD (JupyterBook) v1 for a prototype Level-2 Sea Ice Concentraiton and Sea Ice Edge product for the CIMR mission.

An HTML build of the ATBD is [online](https://cimr-algos.github.io/SeaIceConcentration_ATBD_v2/intro.html).

The ATBD was developed in the context of the ESA-funded CIMR DEVALGO study (2022-2024) (contract 4000137493). More information on the DEVALGO study
and other ATBDs it produced is available from [CIMR-Algos](https://github.com/CIMR-Algos).

This repository is based on an [ATBD-Template](https://github.com/CIMR-Algos/ATBD-Template). See the README file of the ATBD-Template for instructions
how to fetch and build the ATBD.

# Running the prototype algorithms and building the ATBD JupyterBook

To run the prototype algorithms (jupyter notebooks) and build the ATBD (jupyterbook):

1. Fetch the input and reference data and organize it under `data/` as in [data/README.md](./data/README.md)
2. Run `jupyter-book build .`
